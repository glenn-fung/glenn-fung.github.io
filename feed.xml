This is widely applied in the real world, e.g., sports science, psychology, and education. For example, many sport games (e.g., basketball, football, chess) involve two players/teams competing against each other each time. The resulting data can be used in comparative judgment.</p> <h1 id="bradleyterry-model">Bradley–Terry Model</h1> <p>The Bradley–Terry model <d-cite key="btorigin"></d-cite> is commonly applied in comparative judgment. It assumes a set $\mathcal{P}=\left{1,\dots,p\right}$ in which every component is a “player” compared with another by some judges, with $\alpha_i/\alpha_j$ being the probability of $i$ beating $j$. In functional form, the model seeks to estimate \(\text{Logit}\left(\pi_{ij}\right) = \lambda_i-\lambda_j,\) where =$\lambda_i=\log\left(\alpha_i\right)$, $\alpha_i$ and $\lambda_i$ are the ability score and log ability score of player $i$ in $\mathcal{P}$ respectively and $\pi_{ij}$ is the probability of $i$ beats $j$. However, in this context, none of the above variables are known in practice. By the nature of logistic regression, the total number of times that $i$ beats $j$, $Y_{ij}$, is assumed to follow the binomial distribution: [Y_{ij}\sim\text{Binomial}\left(n_{ij},\pi_{ij}\right), ]where $n_{ij}=n_{ji}$ is the number of times that $i$ and $j$ are compared against each other. This unstructured model \eqref{eq:usm} could be further extended to a structured version, in which \(\lambda_i=\sum^p_{q=1}\beta_qx_{iq}+\varepsilon_i,\) where $x_q$’s are explanatory variables and $\varepsilon_i\sim\mathcal{N}\left(0,\sigma^2\right)$ is the random error term. Both fixed and random effects could be used for estimation. The explanatory variables could be attributed to the players being compared (player-specific), to the judge (contest-specific), or to the specific comparison (contest-specific).</p> <h1 id="bayesian-spatial-bradleyterry-model">Bayesian Spatial Bradley–Terry Model</h1> <p>The Bayesian Spatial Bradley–Terry model is specific to spatial data, which allows the learning of abilities from nearby players. See <d-cite key="rowland2022"></d-cite> and <d-cite key="rowlandt"></d-cite>. This model is useful for assessing issues related to human right abuses, such as forced marriage, female genital mutilation, human trafficking, and online child sexual exploitation and abuse.</p> <h1 id="model-fitting">Model fitting</h1> <ul> <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BradleyTerry2</code> package in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R</code> for the Bradley–Terry model: <a href="https://github.com/hturner/BradleyTerry2">https://github.com/hturner/BradleyTerry2</a> <d-cite key="firth2012"></d-cite>.</li> <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BSBT</code> package in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R</code> for the Bayesian Spatial Bradley–Terry model: <a href="https://github.com/rowlandseymour/BSBT">https://github.com/rowlandseymour/BSBT</a> <d-cite key="bsbt"></d-cite>.</li> </ul>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Statistics"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using pairwise comparison data to assess abilities.]]></summary></entry></feed>
