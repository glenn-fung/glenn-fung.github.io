I am Glenn Fung, in my senior year of the Applied Mathematics with Economics program jointly at the University of Birmingham (U.K.) and Jinan University (P.R.C.). My Chinese name in Cantonese is Fung Tsz Yui, and Zirui Feng in Mandarin. I have research experiences in areas such as machine learning, behavior economics, asset pricing, and financial market micro-structure.

Please feel free to use the links below to reach out or [email me](mailto:glenn.fung@outlook.com) at glenn.fung@outlook.com. 

I am looking for graduate studies or predoctoral positions in economics, finance, accounting, marketing, or other quantitative areas related to social sciences and business research, starting the fall of 2024 :)
