I am Glenn Fung, in my senior year of the Applied Mathematics with Economics program jointly at the University of Birmingham (U.K.) and Jinan University (P.R.C.). My Chinese name in Cantonese is Fung Tsz Yui, and Zirui Feng in Mandarin. I have research experiences in areas such as machine learning, behavior economics, asset pricing, and financial market micro-structure.
